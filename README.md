An Instagram app clone that features photos from NASA's image APIs. Users can "like" and "unlike" images and see data for each image.
Since Instagram uses ReactJS, I thought it would be easiest to setup this app with it as well.

This app was initially setup in VS Code using create-react-app. From there, I setup several components to keep the code from getting too hard to read within one component:
- the App
- the Photo
- the Like button
- the Footer

I used Bootstrap to help with responsiveness and to put each photo into a card-style for a clean layout. I also used their icons for GitHub and LinkedIn within the footer.
